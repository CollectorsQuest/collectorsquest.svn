At the age of 42 (14 years ago) I embarked on the biggest project of my life. I bought an ugly house on a 1 acre lot that I loved and proceeded to throw most of it away. They took (9) 30-yard dumpsters out of here before I was through. I rebuilt the house over a 2.5 year period working on it 7 days a week until we moved in.\r\n\r\nI took a standard \"broad-front\" ranch and rearranged the floor plan, opened everything up and added a 2-story 1,300 square foot addition to it. The house had a walk-out lower level with a low ceiling. I tore out 1,600 square feet of concrete and lowered the lower level floor by almost 2 feet. My finished ceiling are now the standard 8-feet tall. This is important to me because I\'m 6\'5\" tall.\r\n\r\nEverything about the house is built around my size and our art collection.

Are you wanting to know the value of my entire Battat collection or inquiring how much I would sell it? I will try and answer both. The highest I have seen a complete set go on ebay is $2,000! Yes, unbelievable. The diplodocus alone I have seen go up as high as $700. So its hard to say how much it really cost, it depends a lot on how you sell the set and how much a person really want it. For me, it is priceless! The set is one of the crown jewel of my entire collection (the other is the WWD set). Which brings us to second question, would I sell it? I am really attached to the set so I have no plan to sell my collection. It is just so rare and hard to acquire, making it almost impossible to replace it without spending lots of $$$. However, I do have some duplicates of some of the figure. I may consider selling or trading to other collectors if they really want it to complete their own collections.

Also, the D has the older f stop graduations, which are slightly different than the Mat. Further differences are the lens type. Most Ds (mne included) have the earlier Yashikor.

I like you only collect glass/crystal snowglobes....I dont too much care for the travel plastic ones.  My favorite ones tend to be Christmas ones though that feature either villages, or cottages, that look cozy and warm, like a Thomas Kinkade painting. I just brought one by Reed & Barton that has a santa and his reindeer rotating aroud a cottage that lights up and its sooo cute! I have about 14 globes in all, and about 9 of them are Christmas oriented. I want to buy more but I\'m running out of room to put them! \r\nIts nice to see another person out there who loves snowglobes like me!

All the other colors had a black rubber electric cord, as this was the period most American manufacturers were getting away from the fabric covered cords. If it were me, I\'d replace the cord with a rubber one, as most collectors I know are not concerned about the originality of the cords, unless it\'s for a very rare or unusual toaster. The Kenmores are really not in that category, although they are very interesting classic toasters. I don\'t have an extra cloth cord that matches the light brown one that is on the brown 3446332. If your toaster is still in use, I\'d recommend putting a rubberized cord on it.  Hope this info is helpful.
