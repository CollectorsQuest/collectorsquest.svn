So what can be said about the 2009 collection?\r\nFirst, the quality and detailing have vastly improved compared to their earlier collections. True to their goal of releasing many species previously unseen as toy figures, they have produced an astonishing diversity of figures.\r\nThe ranges of species encompass the entire globe! In all, there are 18 figures in the medium sized group. The diversity is overwhelming to say the least.\r\nThere are some old favorites making a comeback such as well as some brand new offerings. Sauropods, ceratopsians, the duckbills, Theropods, are all big this year and are well represented. The pterosaurs group is mysteriously not represented this year. The marine reptiles have just one representative, a tylosaur.\r\nCollectA easily doubled the number of figures released this year with a combined total of 25 figures plus some plants! They released the most figures, more than Safari, Schleich, Bullyland, and Papo all combined. What Safari lack in diversity of species, they made up with their release and what they lack in accuracy, Safari made up with their releases.\r\nIt really is nice to see how CollectA has grown and improved the last two years. For a young company who just entered the scene 3 years ago, they have come a long way! Improvements can be seen on most of their new figures. There are still some that are forgettable, like the megalosaurus. Overall, and I maybe the only one who think so, the figures are great. What I find fun about the CollectA/Procon collection is that itâ€™s nice to see how they grow and improve each year. It is not often that we can watch a company improve after their initial release. Too often a company burst into the scene with such great promise, only to fizzle and eventually face extinction without having the opportunity to reach their full potential. Like Safari before them, we can see improvement in each successive release. I hope that the trend of quality figures continue in the years to come. I have no doubt, and again I am sure I am in a minority here, that given a few more years, CollectA will fully reach their full potential. Again, Safari is a good example; it has taken them more than two decades to reach the quality and accuracy that their new releases now enjoy. To date, CollectA/Procon has proven that they can be a major player in the toy figure market.\r\nWith Schelich contracting and limiting their releases to just a few tried and proven figure; Bullyland releasing forgettable, barely registering figures; and Papo, all but abandoned prehistoric this year (a underperforming mammoth, with a striking resemblance to Schleichs), itâ€™s been a head-to-head year between Safariâ€™s exquisite figures and CollectAâ€™s diverse collection. There is no comparing the two line, they both compensate for what the other lack therefore balancing this years offerings.\r\nBoth companies employed very different tactics in dealing with their new releases.\r\nSafari went the way of producing truly amazing, exquisitely detailed figures. In a way, it is inevitable that Safari has to raise the bar on them. They have been a leader in many ways.\r\nCollectAâ€™s strategy is to mine the species diversity and offer as many new figures, many brand new offerings and never been seen as toy figures. Itâ€™s catching up with the big guysâ€¦with a twist.\r\nas Cetiosaurus (standard sauropod, but nicely done. Previously seen only in the Invicta line) and megalosaurus (another Invicta original.

They are old, many circa 1960 -70\"s.  The material used to make the figures are brittle, making it hard to find figures that are intact. The paint is also fragile, they chip off easily.\r\nStarlux released many figures, from Soldiers, modern animals, to prehistoric. I don\'t think they were widely available outside of Europe, but I maybe wrong.\r\nI was first introduced to the line many years ago when a friend gave me a Starlux Styracosaurus to add to my ceratopsian collection. Out of curiosity, I did a search and found that there is a long list of prehistoric figures from them. Unfortunately, I could not locate any source â€¦until I found the joy of evil-bay!\r\nEven then, it was hard to find any Starlux figures and if they do show up, command some serious dollars! So it was a slow attempt to build up the collection. When my interest in prehistoric mammals ( and other non-dinosaurs) developed, I quickly gave up trying to acquire the dinosaurs and instead concentrated my effort ( and $$$) in procuring the mammals, fish, and other non-dinosaurs. I\'m an opportunity, so I still occasionally get some dinosaurs if I find a good deal. Starlux, to date, has some of the most diverse list of prehistoric mammals ( and other non-dinosaurs) ever assembled and produced. Many species were produced for the first time and, unfortunately, never been seen/produced again.\r\nThe list is astonishing! Now we know what footprints CollectA/Procon is following.\r\nThe sculpting is obviously very retro, and some are just plain scary! But there are some real rare  gems in the collection like many of the mammals, fish, amphibians, and birds. For those of you who always scream accuracy, well this line is definitely not for you. For those who appreciate the vintage, the unique style, well this line is a must have to add to your collection.\r\nTo date, my collection is very small. As I already mention, they are hard to find this days and command top dollars when available. It is my hope one day I may be able to complete the mammals and other non-dino animals.\r\n',20,458,13,NULL,0,1,0,1,1,'2009-08-26 13:32:59','2010-02-01 12:55:23'),(1659,8,1447,'The Bobbsey Twins Collection of Books $198.00','the-bobbsey-twins-collection-of-books-198-00','The Bobbsey Twins by Laura Hope collection.
