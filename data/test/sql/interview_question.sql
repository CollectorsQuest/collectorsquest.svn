My mother took off a day of work, and I took off a day of school to go see the premiere when I was little. I remember that day receiving my first collectible piece which was a free poster with all of the cast. THAT was nice. Lion King just stuck out to me at being one of thee most original and still loved movies that I\'ve lasted through the years. I mean with Lion King you get SO MANY different items to collect ranging from Food items, to night-lights, to shirts, hats, costumes, magazines, desk lights, pensâ€¦ EVERYTHING...! It just makes it SO much fun to collect! I recently obtained two new items from a claw machine for my collection as well!',NULL),(2,1,'If there was a fire in your house and you could only grab one item from your collection, what would it be?','1? There is no. 1!!! I\'d grab my waste basket, empty it and fill it to the top before running out with a plushy or two in my teeth! *Laughs* No seriously, when a Tornado siren goes off ,I even fill up my shirt to bring them to safety in the basement to make sure they\'re not blown away! Hmmn, if I had to grab ONE though it would  be either be my Sarabi figure since she is so rare, my TLK book that was customized to me for my birthday LONG AGO by my parents, or this Timon plushy for sentimental reasons.',NULL),(3,1,'Youâ€™ve been fairly innovative in the breadth of your collection. How did you come across some of the stranger categories of food and nightlights?','Well, usually this sort of thing happens by chance. Normally I\'m not expecting to find any food items with Lion King on it nowadays, so when I do I usually snag it just to save the boxes and savor the memories. The Nightlights were something I discovered with my mother when I was little and shopping around Meijer\'s... or K-Mart. We just happened upon them when she went into the home improvement sections of the store. Though there\'s this thrill of excitement when you find these unexpected things!  It\'s like, \"COOL!! I never knew they had that!!\" They used to have a TLK ceiling fan at Home Depot when I was little and I always wanted it, but, mother said no . Crud.',NULL),(4,1,'Do you feel Disneyland should have a ride based on the movie? If so, what do you think it should consist of? Describe your vision.','Well they have the Mad-Hatters TEA CUPS so why not... Rafiki GOES BANANAS?! *laughs* I could see it now, a GIANT Rafiki with branches hanging from his hand that have a banana-car on each end of the branch and they twirl around, and spin  making it look like Rafiki is going crazy with them..! Or perhaps a Water-fall ride where you sit In Pumbaa\'s belly, (Opposed to on, I mean, you\'d fall off!) and you go over the waterfall like you usually see him do!',NULL),(5,1,'Have you seen The Lion King play?','I\'m going to be honest and say that I haven\'t yet seen the official play. At least not that I know of. I\'ve seen a fan-replica play at a local theatre and I believe one IN Disney World in 1995, but at that time the Live-Action stuff NEVER held my interest! In fact I remember going, \"THAT\'S NOT SIMBA!!\" towards the guy who was PRETENDING to be Simba...oops, My bad. I could tell the difference back then!',NULL),(6,1,'How many items do you currently have? Do you keep a running tally? How do you know if you already have it?','140 that I\'ve taken photo\'s of and a good amount of plushies that I\'ve yet to count up, or books that need to be scanned. It\'s a big collection and still growing. I don\'t keep a tally, but I know my collection inside and out. I can look at something and know if I have it. I\'ve had my collection for years so I\'ve memorized it all, especially since most of it I played with everyday.',NULL),(7,1,'Do you let your friends/family give you Lion King stuff or does it have to be self-selected? If you donâ€™t like it, do you send it back?','SURE DO! One less thing for me to buy out of my pocket money! *Laughs* It doesn\'t have to be self selected, but if there\'s an item I\'ve seen that I want badly, I\'ll hint and point it out to try and get it. I NEVER send my gifts back, I love all the items I get... and if I get extra\'s...? Oh well... It\'s always good to have a spare!',NULL),(8,1,'Who is your favorite character and why?','TIMON! He\'s actually an extremely in-depth character. In the first movie you only find out that he\'s an outcast and that he\'s enjoying a life of Hakuna-Matata, but he likes to help his friends. In TLK 2, you find out that he tries to help out his friends again, even if it gets him in trouble...and in TLK 1/2 (my FAVORITE of the movies), you get to meet his mother, his uncle, find out that his father died by Hyena\'s and that his name was Buzz, you find out WHY Timon is an outcast. He\'s got dreams that he wants to achieve. You find out that he can actually be REALLY brave when he wants to...and just SO MUCH more. He\'s a very in-depth character, more than just the jokster that everyone tries to portray.',NULL),(9,1,'If all of the animals in the Lion King and the animals from Bambi go on an Outward Bound trip, whose team whines the most?','That\'s easy, The LION KING crew, because if the Bambi crew whined the most, the TLK crew would eat \'em. After all Deer are similar to antelope! *Laughs* Naawww... the TLK crew would get that anyways, because The Hyena\'s would all whine, then Scar would whine, then Zazu would whine, then Timon would whine, making the others whine and etc... !',NULL),(10,2,'How many kicks do you have at present? What got you started? ','I have 50+ Pairs. I just always loved sneakers. Even as a kid I always had to have the latest kicks. The colors and materials used always interest me. I just feels great have a fresh pair of kicks on. Itâ€™s a confidence booster of sort as well.',NULL),(12,2,'With so many brands on the market, why just Nike?','Okay, letâ€™s get one thing straight  - I donâ€™t only wear Nike. ',NULL),(13,2,'We just figured since you were the head of the Nike Dunk SB group on Facebook.','I have many different brands and respect all of them for their history. How do you choose? Whatever just strikes my eye. Whether it be the colors, materials or overall look. Iâ€™m very, very picky when it comes to sneakers.',NULL),(14,2,'How do you keep on the latest in trends?','I always check with different forums. Www.Hypebeast.com is great for not only sneakers but the latest streetwear as well. Other than that I get RSS and Emails from brands, shops and websites to keep me up on things.',NULL),(15,2,'What kick-wearing star do you admire?','None... ',NULL),(16,2,'Really? Why is that? ','The reason is simple they have tons and tons of money. We have to struggle save up and sometimes spend days on the street for a particular shoe. The celebrities just go to some consignment shop and pay whatever they ask. We are sneakerheads, we collect for the love of the game. They sadly just keep up with trends. Most celebrities are a conventional hypebeast.',NULL),(17,2,'If any celebrity could design a sneaker, who should it be?','I would love to have Elton John design a dunk. As funny as that sounds, I think he could put flavor into the shoe.',NULL),(18,2,'If Zombies were attacking, what sneakers would you want to be wearing and why?','My Black Melvin Dunks. Why? Simple they have a skull on the toe box. They might see it, think I\'m one of them and leave me alone.',NULL),(19,2,'Any shoutouts?','I wanna throw out a shout out to Nike Dunk SB Group on Facebook, Sean Wotherspoon, Rob Holzel, Josh Hashagen, Rob Haddock, Gooey Wong and Liz Delaney.',NULL),(27,4,'How many kicks do you have? What got you started?','Over 250 pairs of Nike sneakers and about 30 pairs of dress shoes - Timberlands, etc.  I\'ve been wearing the same size since 1993, but really I started seriously in 2002 once I got a real job. This game\'s not cheap.',NULL),(28,4,'Let\'s talk fashion. Which shoe for work? For play? For a night out on the town? For date night?','For Work - hard bottoms, ya know Kennth Coles...Bostonian...\r\nFor Play, For A Night Out on the Town or for a Date - Whatever I\'m feeling. I just have to match the colors, that needs to be right. Jordan Dunks Air Force Ones whatever. I don\'t discriminate. I have a lot of choices.',NULL),(29,4,'It\'s the green revolution, and the focus is on recycling. What do you do with you old kicks?','LOL! I don\'t have any old kicks. Even the old ones from \'93 still look new and the ones that \"bit the dust\" became house shoes or kicks to cut the grass in. I do have the New Jordan 23s which are made with Environment friendly materials as a part of Nike\'s \"Considered Project\".',NULL),(30,4,'Do you deliberately taunt friends when you get new kicks? Has a fight ever erupted?','Nah, no taunting. They know I\'m the King, LOL! I know saying that I\'m the king can be seen as a taunt to others. There are people with more kicks than me. I feel my collection has enough original, rare, limited and exclusive releases to say I\'m the King Quality over Quantity. Plus I love Haters. They just let\'s me know my kick game is proper!',NULL),(31,4,'How many of your friends collect sneakers? Are they a large part of your social group?','Most of my friends like kicks but not like me. I Love it! It\'s my favorite hobby and everybody that knows me knows that it\'s my thing',NULL),(32,4,'If you could create an Action Hero that wore kicks, what would his/her name be? What special powers would they have?','There already was an Action Hero that wore kicks...Michael Jordan!',NULL),(33,5,'Would you ever sell you collection? If so, how much? If not, why?','If times got hard (and I mean REALLY hard) financially, I would probably sell my whole collection for about $2,000. As much as I love shoes, I understand that they are merely posessions that can be replaced. I do love \'em though!',NULL),(34,5,'If you can supply the entire world with a sneaker that is super cool and comfortable which would you choose and why?','Supras Skytops! They\'re awesome. Mad comfortable. Awesome design went into those. They feel great on your feet. Plus, they\'re stylish, what more could the world need?',NULL),(35,5,'Do you ever wear anything else? Why?','I wear dress shoes occasionally. For formal events and such. But for the most part I stick to sneaks. I try incorporating them into my ensemble anyway possible. I\'ll probably wear a nice pair of Nike Dunks to my wedding.',NULL),(36,5,'It\'s the Wild West and there\'s a showdown at 5pm. Which kicks are going to be doing battle and why?','Hmmmm. Most likely my 14k Gold Supra Skytops. They\'re really shiny so they might blind my adversary. And if they don\'t, and I happen to meet my demise at the showdown, at least people will know I had a fly pair of kicks.',NULL),(37,5,'Would you date/marry someone who wasn\'t a sneaker collector? Could you tolerate poor taste in footwear?','I could certainly marry someone who wasn\'t a collector, but a good shoe sense is mandatory. You can tell a lot about a person just by lookin\' at their shoes. Now if I could only remember who said that...',NULL),(38,5,'How many kicks do you have? What got you started?','I have 26 awesome pairs of kicks at the moment. 20 are with me, 4 are at a friends and 2 are under a bed somewhere in Brooklyn. I got started for two main reasons. The first being that my dad refused to buy me a pair of shoes over $30 dollars when I was younger. Having nice expensive sneakers (especially in the African-American community) is almost a must. So I always dreamed of the day I would have some nice kicks and I vowed from a young age that whenever I had my own money I would buy as many shoes as I wanted. The other reason was I just really became interested in the individuals who designed certain iconic shoes. I just became more and more interested in the technical and design aspects of kicks which just furthered my infatuation with them.',NULL),(339,6,'How many kicks do you have? What got you started?','I have approximately 30 pairs of sneakers. I got started during my freshman year of college. I had always had a love for sneakers, but I had some friends down the hall who were very big fans of Nike Air Jordan\'s. I bought two pairs of Jordan\'s that year and have been hooked ever since! Since then I have branched out Nike SB dunks and the Nike Air Max series. I don\'t really purchase outside of Nike & Jordan Brand.',NULL),(340,6,'Who inspires you in the sneaker world? Why?','I would say that my inspiration originated with the love my friends and I shared for sneakers. Then as my knowledge grew on the \"shoe game\" I started to notice others who had the same passion as we did. Whether it was seeing others on sneaker forums/blogs, people on the street,  or even celebrities rocking sneakers. It was always fun waking up on Saturday mornings, when new sneakers are usually released, and standing in line for the newest pair. There are a lot of memories my friends and I have shared over the last 6 years. The \"hunt\" is sometimes the best part of being a collector.',NULL),(341,6,'You are assigned the task of outfitting professional sports teams - what','The Jordan Brand actually has Team Jordan which consists of not only the best players in the NBA, but those in other professional sports leagues. If I had to pick a shoe for the NBA I would go with the Nike Air Jordan XI because it is my favorite pair. MLB players like Derek Jeter and Andrew Jones, both who are on Team Jordan, have sported the Air Jordan IV & IX respectively. I think both of those designs made good cleats for MLB. I don\'t think any pair of sneakers would make good ice skates though... LOL',NULL),(342,6,'What is one improvement that you believe sneakers designers should consider?','Nike/Jordan Brand like to re-release sneakers that were popular in the past. Sometimes the quality doesn\'t seem up to par with the original releases. For example, I had always anticipated the re-release of the Air Jordan IV\'s, but after seeing them I don\'t even want them anymore. Sometimes they also oversaturate the market and it takes away from the value of the sneakers.',NULL),(343,6,'If you could create an Action Hero that wore kicks, what would his/her name be? What special powers would they have?','I would name my Action Hero BAP (my initials..lol). He would fight against all those who sell fake sneakers and have a pair of sneakers on hold for his creator at every release.',NULL),(344,6,'If you had to start all over again, would you do anything differently?','Most recently, I have been selling some of my collection. If I could do it all again I wouldn\'t have bought some of the color-ways that I did. Instead, I would only buy the rarest sneakers and save my money for the pairs I love the most.',NULL),(345,7,'How many PEZ do you have? What got you started? ','You know, I have done many interviews and that seems to be a question that I get asked often.  So, a long time ago I started to count - 1, 2, 3, 100, 101 and I got up to about 400 and figured this is crazy!  I have several thousand.  I have boxes full of PEZ.  I have everything PEZ.  I\'m addicted!  I\'m a PEZ-a-holic! \r\nI got started collecting in the late 80\'s. I used to sell antiques at flea markets - a sideline business.  I never really collected anything.  Someone told me I should collect something.  So, one day I was in a grocery store and saw a PEZ dispenser.  I remembered having PEZ as a kid so I bought it.  It has been downhill since!',NULL),(346,7,'You are a very active player in the PEZ world. How/When did you decide to step it up and become an organizer/leader?  ','Well, letâ€™s see.  How can I explain this?  Like I said before, I\'m a PEZ-a-holic.  To feed my habit I started to deal in PEZ.  Whatever I made I put back into my collection.  So I got pretty involved in the PEZ hobby as a dealer.  Then, there was only one PEZ newsletter for collectors back then.  They were calling it quits.  I didn\'t want to see that happen.  The PEZ hobby needed a newsletter.  I thought; how hard can it be to write a newsletter?  BTW- I had no computer or typing expierence to speak.  In my Junior High typing class I cheated-I looked at the keys and still do.  Believe it or not, English wasn\'t my best subject in High School either.  Email and the Internet at that time was just starting to grow. So, here I am happily doing my newsletter a couple years later, collecting PEZ and having a grand ole time.  Since I lived within driving distance of \"The PEZ White House\" and I had an excuse to go visit \"The PEZident\" and his loyal following.  Oh, I mean I lived close to the PEZ factory in Orange, CT and had a reason to meet with the PEZ execs from time to time.  Then, there it was!  On one of my \"business trips\" to PEZ I saw this brand new hotel right around the corner from the PEZ factory!  I said to myself, \"self, thatâ€™s the perfect place to hold a PEZ convention\".  So, then the Northeast PEZ Convention in CT was born.  A couple years after that I thought how much I liked Myrtle Beach and that would be great place to have a fall get togetherâ€¦ another convention.  If that wasn\'t enough, then I was talking to another collector who happened to be a travel agent and she talked to me about cruises.  So, I thought that getting PEZheads together for a cruise would be a good idea and \"PEZheads at Sea\" was born.  Through all of this, one thing I always had in the back of my mind was to make a PEZ licensed item for collectors.  Then it hit me, PEZ licensed collector pins.  So, PEZ Pinz was born.  One thing this all taught me, I have to stop thinking.  I only get myself into trouble when I think.  I never intended to step up and be an organizer.  Things just fell into place.  But like they say, things happen for a reason.  So, when my Mother gave me a piece of PEZ candy 45 years ago I bet she had no idea what it would do to me.',NULL),(347,7,'Sophieâ€™s Choice scenario (like the movie). Your two favorite PEZ are held captive. You can only choose one to save and the other will be destroyed. We understand this is a difficult one. Which do you save?   ','You know, that is a tough question.  They all are my favorite.  Itâ€™s tough to pin down just 2 dispensers.  Well... Ok....One would be the Policeman PEZ Pal dispenser.  Because I was a Police Officer I would have to say that one.  The other dispenser would be Coca Marsh Spaceman.  Now, which would I save?  I would have to save the Spaceman because I remember having one of them as a kid.  Thatâ€™s the reason I started to collect PEZ.  My fond memories of PEZ as a kid.  Did I mention that I have this big vending machine in my office because I remember getting PEZ from a vending machine?  Sorry, back to your question.  Knowing Cops the way I do I know the Policeman PEZ Pal can save himself!  If he couldnâ€™t save himself then I would have to use one of the other 20 or so Policeman PEZ Pal dispensers in my collection to be my favorite Policeman PEZ Pal dispenser.  Every good Cop has back up!   ',NULL),(348,7,'Tell us a bit about the hotel culture. When did conventions starts going from room to room instead of a convention floor?','Well, most of the conventions still have a \"floor show\".  The going â€œroom to roomâ€, us PEZheads in the hobby call it \"Room Hopping\".  Room Hopping is more like an added bonus.  To me, when you go Room Hopping it feels like when I was a young boy going \"Trick or Treating\".  You run from room to room collecting goodies.  Except you have to pay for the goodies and the prize you get is PEZ dispensers.  Oh, there are no eggs or shaving cream involved, but thatâ€™s another story.',NULL),(349,7,'If you could make choose any historical/literary figure to become a PEZ dispenser, who would it be and why? Describe the dispenser.','Does being the Editor of a PEZ newsletter make me a literary figure?  Ok... Guess it wouldn\'t be me.  Well, then my next choice would be to make an Edward Hass III PEZ dispenser.  He is the one that invented PEZ candy and if it wasnâ€™t for him we wouldnâ€™t be worshiping those little plastic dispensers.  Amen!  Praise to the PEZ god!  Now, I\'m sure I had seen a picture of him.  But you know people donâ€™t really make interesting PEZ dispensers unless they look unique.  So, I would make him look kind of like Abe Lincoln.  Ok, so maybe a PEZ dispenser that looks like Abe wonâ€™t sell, so maybe that Newsletter Editor PEZ dispenser isnâ€™t such a bad choice?  ',NULL),(350,7,'Do good PEZ ever die? What happens if one breaks?','PEZ...die???  What are you crazy!  I take good care of my PEZ.  I dust them, talk to them and they tell me how they feel.  If they donâ€™t feel good I take them to the PEZ Doctor, Ha Ha...I bet I had you for a minute there!  The PEZ don\'t talk-back silly!  LOL!!!  But I do take care of them.  If one is broken I try to fix it.  If it can\'t be fixed I save it.  I just can\'t throw any PEZ away.   ',NULL),(351,8,'How many PEZ do you have? What got you started? ','Thousands - more than 1,000 less than 10,000. Somewhere in between. I usually just answer with how many I need and that is 2.  I need 2 more dispensers to have at least one example of every dispenser PEZ ever sold at retail. (The two I need as of June 2008 are an owl whistle and Alpine Man from the 1972 winter Olympics).  I just thought they were fun. I like the colors, the way they work, the characters, etc. It\'s candy and a toy all in one. What\'s not to like?  At the time it was just something to look for at flea markets, little information was known about the history of PEZ when I got started. So I had no idea what to even look for.',NULL),(352,8,'Your new book just came out. 3rd edition right? What is different about this one?','Correct. This is my THIRD full size book!  I would have never guessed I would be writing books about PEZ dispensers! This book just builds on my previous two editions. Each time I put a  new book out, I try to add as much vintage items as I do the new releases.  My intent is to include enough vintage items that people will be interested in buying a new book. If I can\'t do that there would really be no reason for somebody to spend $25 on a book to look at a bunch of new release items that people probably have recently added to their collection. I want it to be a reference that both new and seasoned collectors will enjoy.  So far, I think I have done that. The positive comments I continue to receive and the fact book sales are good are strong indications there is a lot of interest in PEZ collecting. ',NULL),(353,8,'Who inspires you in the PEZ world? Why?  ','Anybody that has a spark of passion about their collection. After almost 20 years now of collecting PEZ, I still get excited about this and I really enjoy talking to other collectors that have that same passion. If I had to mention names, Maryann Kennedy, she was into all of this and had the passion for PEZ long before anybody else even thought to collect these things. The information she was able to gather and the amount of knowledge she has shared over the years is for sure inspiring. David Welch, he really opened the door to this whole thing for me. Once his first book came out in \'91 or \'92 showing all of the known dispensers I was hooked!  Credit to him.  John LaSpina, when I got started he was pretty well established already and has amassed a fantastic collection, he is one of the friendliest people and always has a great selection of vintage items for sale. There are other people, actually a pretty good list of people who have made a genuine difference in the hobby but those were 3 people I was introduced to early on, all are still actively collecting.  I think that speaks for their passion & enjoyment of the hobby. ',NULL),(354,8,'If you could create an Action Hero that was based on PEZ, what would his/her name be? What special powers would they have?  ','I don\'t know about that question - pass please.',NULL),(355,8,'Desert Island Classic â€“ which three dispensers/items would you take to keep you company?','Jungle Mission flashlight- it has several features that would come in handy, the Pez dispenser/writing pen to write notes with, maybe a make-a-face, if I\'m stranded I guess I could occupy my time by rearranging the face pieces over and over.',NULL),(356,8,'If you had to start all over again, would you do anything differently?  ','I would probably be forced to have more of a focus.  When I started prices were a fraction of what they are now so I don\'t think I would have the variety in my collection if I had to start again- I couldn\'t afford it!  I think I would just pick my favorites and not be so obsessed with trying to have each one.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(357,9,'How many Pez do you have?','I would say I have around 600 PEZ products, most of them being dispensers.',NULL),(358,9,'How did you get started?','When I was in high school I went to visit my brother in college.  He went to Tulane University in Louisiana.  When I was there for Mardi Gras, I ended up crashing in his roommates room.  As I was impressionable, I noticed he had a shelf that lined the entire top of the room.  It turn out he had a PEZ collection and it was all vintage PEZ.  I just thought it was totally cool. Also, I would be going to college in two years so I thought it would be cool to do the same thing. That is where the collection started.  After 40  PEZ dispensers I thought it would be cool to continue and so I did.  I enjoy the taste of the candy, the fun dispensers and the history behind the candy. I still enjoy collecting and focus more on the vintage.',NULL),(359,9,'What is the most rare/unusual item in your collection?','The custom dispenser I have of the PEZ gone wild.  It\'s a  fantasy PEZ. A blonde woman flashing her b--bs with a sign at the bottom that say\'s \"PEZ Gone Wild.\"',NULL),(360,9,'How did you come across it?','I found an artist that would create new and original PEZ for me.  I got Abraham Lincoln, Bob Marley, PEZ Gone Wild and Osama Bin Laden.',NULL),(361,9,' If you could start a new line of Pez, what would it be?

If you were to create a commercial, what product would it be for and which PEZ will you use?','I would do a fun commercial for PEZ.  It would be this graphic world of PEZ vintage dispensers that could fly, sing and dance in this whole imaginary land. It would soon become a tv show and then to a PEZ movie staring Brad Pitt as Pez Boy. LOL.',NULL),(363,1,'Have you ever been to a convention? What possessed you to go?','Yes, I went to the convention in Connecticut in 2006. I am a collector so I was always interested to see what went on at the conventions. Also to see if I could find some vintage dispensers I wanted.',NULL),(364,9,'What was the most surprising element about it?','How nice the people are. Not strange like I envisioned.  It was very family oriented and cool to hang out with some of the hard core guys.  Namely RED!  Thanks for the PEZ shot.  (That\'s one part vodka and 2 part PEZ powder.)',NULL),(365,9,'What is your â€œHoly Grailâ€ item with regard to your Pez collection?','I would love a couple of the original Thor.  Also the political PEZ,  it\'s a clear red elephant. Looks like one of the crystal edition PEZ but before their time.',NULL),(366,11,'How many items do you have? How did you get started?','I currently have approximately 250 items if I include all Kenner toys, action figures, buttons, books, model kits, etc. I began collecting shortly after introducing my son to the original trilogy. It really sparked my interest in Star Wars all over again. I began with a few vintage action figures and ships---items I had when I was a child and dearly missed.',NULL),(367,11,'When did you first view Star Wars? What drew you in?','I was five years old when my father took me to the old downtown theatre here in Calgary to see the movie. His coworkers were all talking about it at workâ€”how amazing the movie was and all the special effects, etc. Even from that young age, my memory of watching the movie is vivid. To a child in the 1970â€™s, keeping in mind all the movies we had seen up to that date, Star Wars was unbelievably mind-blowing.',NULL),(368,11,'Which is/are the most prized items in your collection?','My Roman Ceramics R2-D2 coin bank, made in 1977, is probably my most prized item. They can be hard to find and usually command quite a high price on Ebay, for example.\r\n\r\nAside from its rarity, I find it to be a very visually stunning piece of 1970â€™s Star Wars memorabilia.\r\n',NULL),(369,11,'What one piece of Star Wars memorabilia do you think needs to be created?','Hands down, it would be the Tantive IV, otherwise known as Princess Leiaâ€™s Blockade Runner spaceship. We see this in the opening scene of A New Hope. Although several small-scale ships have been made, I feel a large one to accommodate the action figures would be a really desirable item. Although it would have to be large, I believe the market is there with the collectors to make this a viable project, should it ever be considered by Hasbro.',NULL),(370,11,'Jedi or Sith? Which philosophy do you agree with more?','Definitely Jedi. I feel several key Jedi beliefs are strikingly similar to many of my own spiritual philosophies pertaining to us here on earth at present.',NULL),(371,11,'If you were able to wield a new force power, what would it be?','If it was possible to create and use a force power, I would choose the ability to materialize something out of nothing. I would materialize a new Ford Mustang in my driveway, among other things!',NULL),(372,10,'How many items do you have? How did you get started?',' I have never counted the total number of Star Wars related items that I own and to be honest I don\'t think I ever want to as they are legion! What\'s that? I must try and give you an estimate... OK, I\'d guess at around 5,000 different items, the biggest single part of which is my haul of Hasbro/Kenner 3 & 3/4\" action figures which at best estimate totals around 700 figures (nice Jedi mind trick!). I started collecting seriously in 1999 when my wife\'s best friend Nicola bought six Episode I action figures for my birthday (this included Darth Maul) but I believe the first Star Wars item I ever owned (and therefore what technically started my collection) was the Empire Strikes Back storybook which I bought after seeing the film at the cinema in 1980 aged 7 years old. The book is no longer in my collection as I lent it to a deaf friend called Damian who never returned it!',NULL),(373,10,'What character would you add to the Series if you could create your own? Describe it.','I\'m a massive fan of Admiral Ackbar, the fishy general in charge of the attack on the second Death Star so I\'d love to see one of his species, the Mon Calamari (the very heart and soul of the Rebel Alliance), wearing the famous brown robes and sitting next to Yoda on the Jedi Council. My Mon Cal Jedi would be a Qui-Gon Jinn style maverick in tune with the living force and not afraid to set the little green guy right on occasion.',NULL),(374,10,'Where does one get the Storm Trooper outfit we see you in? Did you build that yourself?','I have neither the skill nor the spare time to be an authentic armour builder and am slightly ashamed to admit that I bought my armour from a nice man in Stockport who needed to sell it even though his kids didn\'t want him to. I have made slight modifications to the suit myself and I\'m sure more will be necessary as I embrace the middle age spread early. I totally admire every member of a costuming group that has made their own armour, they have way more right to wear the glorious white of Vader\'s foot soldiers than I do!',NULL),(375,10,'As a reporter for Star Wars Action News, what is the most surprising thing you have ever heard from a fan?','It still surprises me that some fans can harbour such bile about the prequel films. Episodes I, II & III were never going to capture the same exact magic of the original trilogy but they are still STAR WARS and that\'s all I need as a fan. So Jar-Jar Binks is annoying and George can\'t write convincing romantic dialogue, for me it all gets overlooked when I hear the throbbing hum of a lightsaber.',NULL),(376,10,'What do you love most about your job?','Being asked to report for the most innovative and exciting Star Wars podcast in the known galaxy by the head of Venganza Media and host Arnie Carvalho was the opportunity I was waiting for to share my love for the films with Star Wars fans, both in the UK and across the world, I am still honoured that I can make a humble contribution to such a ground breaking production. SWAN is not just a Star Wars podcast it\'s a vibrant, friendly community of collectors who share the highs and lows of the hunt whilst helping each other in their search for that hard to find, must have item. The best thing about reporting for the podcast has got to be a toss up between giving fans in the US who can\'t make it to Europe an insight into conventions such as Celebration Europe in London and Jedi-Con in Dusseldorf and being able to be the go-to-guy for listeners around the world who need help in getting exclusives they otherwise might not be able to get hold of.',NULL),(377,10,'Did Greedo shoot first?','No way and neither did he shoot at the exact same time as Han - way to wimp out George! There can only be one interpretation of that fateful afternoon in the Mos Eisley Cantina and that\'s that Han, self-serving bastard that he was then, took out Greedo before the dim-witted Rodian could take the safety catch of his own piece.\r\n\r\nA little tip for you - check out the Adywan fan-edit of the film (called \'Star Wars Revisited\') for the \'real\' footage of how it all played out!',NULL),(378,12,'How many items do you have in your collection? How did you get started?','I honestly do not know exactly how many items I have in my collection, but I know that itâ€™s very extensive.  If I had to take a hypothetical guess I would have to say a few thousand individual pieces give or take, but thatâ€™s just a guess.  I have always been interested in collecting and as a child I had small hobbies, like collecting stamps and coins.  Growing up Star Wars was my favorite movies and series of toys, but I sold my childhood toys except for a few pieces as a young adult (I am very, very sorry for that).  In 1998/99 with the exciting news that the original trilogy was going to be re-released, followed by Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace I decided that it would be cool to get back into collecting Star Wars.  So with every new Star Wars item I bought I started to re-live my childhood and it was very addicting and fun.\r\n',NULL),(379,12,'In the box or out of the box? Do you have two sets - one to preserve and one to play with?','Anything I buy new I keep in its original packaging except anything that was bought opened, like off eBay or something.  I know that a lot of collectors say that they take their figures out to display and enjoy them and thatâ€™s fine, but for me I love to keep things as new as possible and leaving them in their boxes or packages will make sure that the figure inside will be kept as new as possible.  I do not have any intentions of selling my collection, but the value dose rise when things are kept new.  \r\n I have a lot of The Power of the Force 2 figures bought out of their packages and mostly all my original figures are also out of their packages and I do enjoy picking them up and looking at them.  It is very satisfying to be able to pick them up and hold them and it does cross my mind sometimes to open everything I have to play with, but to me the packaging is as important to the collection as is the figure inside.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(380,12,'The Star Wars Trilogy or the First Three? How does this affect the items in your collection?','The original trilogy in my opinion will always be the best; these were the three that started it all.  I love the look and packaging of the newer figures, but the new toys (1995 and up) do not compare to the original toys made by Kenner.  The vintage part of my Star Wars collection is honestly my favorite and itâ€™s something I take pride in and love to talk about.',NULL),(381,12,'If you could create a new line of Star Wars memorabilia, what would it be?','It\'s hard to create a new product line, Star Wars seems to have explored all possible marketing angles, but if I could create a new line of Star Wars memorabilia it would have to be more interactive toys and more different kinds of action figures from the movies.',NULL),(382,12,'The breadth of your collection is extensive, where do you store all of it? Is your fiancee tolerant?','I currently store my Star Wars collection in whatâ€™s now known as my â€œStar Wars Closetâ€.  I am really looking forward to buying a house in a few years so I can get my collecting room to showcase all my Star Wars and other interests, like vintage video game consoles and toys from the 1980â€™s.  My fiancÃ©e Allison is very supportive in my collection, but she is quick to remind me when I start to get carried away, and I do get carried away from time to time.  ',NULL),(383,12,'Do you plan on passing on any of your collection to your children or do they need to start their own?','One of the best things about collecting is sharing the passion for collecting with your child.  My six year old daughter collects things of her own and keeps them freely in their original packages displayed in her room.  I am very proud that sheâ€™s showing an interest in collecting and has done so from a very young age and she takes pride in knowing that as long as she keeps her Disney dolls in their original packages they will always be new.  She has dolls she collects and dolls she plays with, she decides what she wants to open and what she wants to keep new and that\'s part of the fun.  I will pass my collection down to my daughter in time.',NULL),(384,13,'How many Barbies do you have? What got you started?','I have a modest collection that currently stands at 58 lovely dolls.  All but a few are removed from their boxes and on display in my study.  About three years ago, by a sheer fluke, while doing a search on Ebay for â€œEgyptian themed jewelry,â€ I came across the Queen of the Nile Barbie.  She was fantastic â€“ exactly how I pictured beautiful Cleopatra.  After a lengthy bidding war I managed to claim my prize.  Afterwards I did some research on the Barbie website and discovered that this particular doll is a part of their â€œWorld Cultureâ€ series.  I was intrigued by the variety and scope â€“ countries from Africa to Poland were represented and each doll wore a culturally significant costume.  I explored the series further to learn that they had a â€œPrincessâ€ collection, where each doll has unique facial features representative of each culture â€“ and thatâ€™s what finally hooked me â€“ I realized that Barbie produced dolls that were not simply carbon copies of each other.  Dolls should be unique â€“ just like people.    ',NULL),(385,13,'With your hot pink hair, we never would have pegged you for a Barbie collector. What kind of reactions do you get when you tell people?','I hear that all the time.  Iâ€™d say that 90% simply donâ€™t believe me.  Iâ€™ve had some that insist on visiting my house.   Some want me to bring a doll into work as proof.  Others want to see photos.  Once I start talking about my collection itâ€™s a bit easier for them to believe â€“ as one of my favorite hobbies is traveling, both international and domestic.  I love experiencing new cultures, odd festivals, and off the beaten path adventures.  When I talk about the costumes of each doll, most people are surprised to discover that Barbie isnâ€™t just a fashion plate childrenâ€™s toy â€“ almost as surprised as they were to discover that Iâ€™m a collector.',NULL),(386,13,'Describe Barbie\'s ideal male doll.','Without a doubt, he should have a facial piercing or a tattoo.  OK, maybe not, but I know for sure he should be just as diverse as she is â€“ as traveled, strong, kind, and independent.  Soâ€¦I guess that pretty much means they need to start producing my husband as their new Ken doll â€“ sans the body jewelry and ink.  ',NULL),(387,13,'What are your feelings on the allegations that Barbie doesn\'t represent a real women and distorts women\'s images of themselves?','Turn on the television, open a magazine, click an internet browser and youâ€™ll see images that demonstrate an inaccurate picture of a womanâ€™s body.  I actually agree that Barbie distorts girlâ€™s views of themselves, but in general I find that most dolls on the market are similar in this fashion.  Children will always play with dolls â€“ itâ€™s simply a fact.  As such theyâ€™ll be confronted with a stereotypical doll shape no matter which toy they purchase.  But they key is that Barbie does represent real women â€“ women of different countries, different colors, different festivals.  So maybe the dolls donâ€™t represent different sized women - no toy is perfect.  For that matter, no toy production company is perfect either.',NULL),(388,13,'Why do you think little girls are fascinated by Barbie?','To be perfectly honest I think most children are first fascinated with Barbie because they are given them as gifts.  As such, the question is, â€œWhat about Barbie fascinates adults?â€  I think for any age group a doll can represent something you donâ€™t have in your life â€“ it could be a pony or an ability to travel to Peru.  As such, if you see a Barbie with a tiny horse stable or a doll wearing a woven shawl from the Andes, youâ€™re probably going to buy the toy.  If Barbie produces a doll thatâ€™s living your dream, (or the dream of a child you know,) or produces a doll that symbolizes a memory for you, of a certain point in your life that you want to think fondly on, youâ€™ll probably be laying down money pretty quick - this time for sentimental reasons.  Itâ€™s human nature.  Iâ€™m no different â€“ these dolls remind me of places Iâ€™ve been and symbolize adventures Iâ€™ll have in the future.',NULL),(389,13,'If one of your Barbie\'s could come to life, who would you choose to hang out with for an evening? What would you do?','It would have to be my Egyptian Queen.  A first love is so very strong.  Iâ€™ve had a fascination with Egyptian culture for quite some time, so of course Iâ€™d do the standard line of questioning about how hot was it really during the summer, did the silk gowns give you  heat rash, did the black kohl run when you sweat.  You know, the important questions.  Weâ€™d probably just enjoy a quiet evening chat over a dinner of chickpeas and cool iced tea.  Of course my answer would be different if the Oktoberfest Barbie came to life and brought me all the pints I could drinkâ€¦  \r\n',NULL),(390,14,'How many do you have and what got you started?','I estimate about 30 Barbies.  A lot of my Barbies are from these two teenagers who played with Barbie, but grew out of them so they gave them to me. That is where a lot of them came from.  Also, a lot of them came from my cousin, mom and dad. Ever since I had my first Barbie, I really like them and I like dressing them, I like playing with them, I just like looking at them and taking pictures of them.  And now I have a collection of all these Barbies.',NULL),(391,14,'Do you share with your sister? Does mom make you?','Yes I do!  But I found one really nice Snow White Barbie lying on the street - It could have cost thirty dollars and I donâ€™t let my sister touch that one or the Dorothy Barbie from Wizard of Oz.    Sometimes with the others we like to put makeup on them or dye their hair with markers, but Iâ€™m afraid she might put makeup on those two and they are really special to me.',NULL),(392,14,'If you were going to act out a scene w/ your Barbies, who would you use and describe the scene:','I use my Barbies as models because I want to be a fashion designer.  I would use my Dorothy Barbie , sheâ€™s my favorite because she is really pretty. I would use my Snow White Barbie and I would use the one I dyed her hair and dressed like Avril Lavigne. I would also use one that I donâ€™t have a name for her, but she is really pretty and has brown hair â€“ my aunt got that for me. I would use all five of my Ken dolls and 2 Kelly dolls.  I would have them act out a scene in two cars, one with the boys and one with the girls.  They would crash the cars and then they would become friends and then at the end they all have the same job.',NULL),(395,14,'If you could choose one of your Barbies to be your best friend, who would it be and why?','My Dorothy Barbie and a collector Birthday Barbie my best friend gave me.  I think if they were alive they would be nice people .',NULL),(396,14,'Do you play with your Barbies ? What do you play?',' I put them out on display to later take pictures of themâ€¦theyâ€™re my models.  I do sometimes play with them.  I want to be a fashion designer and I dress them in clothing and with my cousin, make fashion magazines because we donâ€™t have real life models.  So I take pictures of them.',NULL),(397,14,'What Barbie are you dying to have?','There are these collector Barbies that are really pretty and I want them, there are two of them:  Barbies with the outfit of the color of your birthstone and they have a dog and a leash with the color of your birthstone too.  I really, really want that.  And the other is a new Holiday Barbie, she is really pretty and I want her.  There is also this nice Barbie House that I want to get and a Barbie computer game that comes with little cards and you match them.',NULL),(398,14,'Do you think you will always collect Barbie? Will you give it to your little girls if you have them?','I would give them to them, but they would also be mine.  But I would also get my kids Barbies.  I think I will play with Barbies until I am old.  They\'re my favorite toys, I like collecting them and playing with them and all these things...I would still give them to my kids but I would play with them too.  After they\'re done they could put them back in container and bring them back to my room because they\'re mine. I really like Barbie.\r\n',NULL),(399,15,'How many Barbies do you have? What got you started?','I have around 30 Barbie dolls. I got started not with Barbies but with bigger dolls and then got some Barbies too. My first one was the Versace Barbie, I bought that here in Greece from a friend\'s toy store, it was intended for another collector but he did not get around to buying her, so I stepped in!',NULL),(400,15,'Greece is thought of as a very macho country. How does collecting Barbies fit in with that?','It does raise some eyebrows but most people get excited to see them. Even men!\r\n\r\n',NULL),(401,15,'If you were going to re-enact a classic movie with Barbie dolls, which one would it be?','Gone With The Wind would be a great candidate as well as My Fair Lady. And maybe even Chicago!',NULL),(402,15,'Have you ever gone to a Barbie convention?If so, tell us your reaction to the first one? If not, what would your expectations be for one in Greece?','Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend one, the costs for me are too big. A convention in Greece would be a great idea! I would be willing to help organize that of course!\r\n\r\n',NULL),(403,15,'If you could design an outfit for Barbie, would what it be?

Who do you admire in the industry and why?','Thank you for your kind words. I always loved dolls and my fashion studies enhanced that. I find doll creation a very artistic challenge and the amount of detail and labour that goes into that is amazing. Dolls can tell stories and inspire dreams to people. I love that.',NULL),(405,19,'How many Lego sets do you have? What got you started?','According to my last count I have 117 sets, both from my youth and my later years of collection Lego Technic.',NULL),(406,19,'Where do you draw your inspiration for your Lego creations?','I don\'t really build that many creations of my own, but when I do it\'s because I try to re-create a set with pieces I already own or I\'m inspired by something I saw on www.brickshelf.org',NULL),(407,19,' We noticed you like a lot of vehicle based Lego.

If not, would you organize one?','No I haven\'t, and I don\'t think I ever will, I\'m too afraid to lose any off the tiny parts.',NULL),(409,19,'What is the most challenging set you have ever done?','Probably both Technic supercars, 8880 and 8466.',NULL),(410,19,'What piece do you think Lego should create that would make your creations easier?','I think Lego should focus on reducing the amount of different pieces instead of adding more.',NULL),(411,17,'How many Lego sets do you have? What got you started?','I would guess that I have about 60-70 sets scattered about my basement, on various shelves, ledges, and windowsills. I keep my instruction booklets in a small filing cabinet, which has saved me on more than one occasion when something gets knocked off a shelf.\r\n\r\nLike most people, I had a bunch of Lego when I was a kid. This was in the 70\'s, when the sets were mostly bricks with a few Space Lego sets available. Then when I was about 24, I was wandering through Wal-Mart and saw the Witch\'s Windship (set 6037). I bought it on a whim, loving the molded pieces and the fun of having a Lego set once again. From there, I started accumulating more and more, focusing mostly on the Star Wars stuff, and Pirates (including Islanders).',NULL),(412,17,'How did you get into creating mosaics out of Lego?','I took my son to the local Science Center on day, and the Lego Egypt display was on tour. I was of course very excited about all the various sculptures, but the item that really drew my eye was a mosaic of some ancient Egyptians. It was so intricate and big, and I was very taken with it. I went home and found a picture of my son, and made a small picture of him (which can be found my collection here). I bought a few bulk brick sets with lots of small pieces in various colors and put those to use. After that, I started making more and more, and it just took off from there.',NULL),(413,17,'Can you describe the process of how you would create one? How do you decide the colors and the layering?','Usually I\'ll throw ideas around in my head for a while, or look for an image that I think will turn into a Mosaic well. Some pictures lend themselves well to mosaics, others don\'t. Usually things with text, or too many colors can be difficult. Most of my \"portrait\" stuff is grayscale, I like it a lot, I think it brings out faces very well. Once I have picture I like, I\'ll run it through some image software and play with the contrast and saturation, to simplify the color range. Once I have something I like, I map out the colors and locations, and start laying out the piece. Color choice and layering style will depend on what the picture is, how much shading is needed, and whether I\'m looking for sharp contrast lines or gradual shading.',NULL),(414,17,'If you could create one Lego piece that doesn\'t exist and why?','For mosaics with lots of textures, I would create a \"plus\" + shaped piece, basically 2 1x3s overlapped. The texture pieces tend to use a lot of those, and it would save a bit of time, and save me from buying more 1x1s, which it seems like I\'m constantly doing. (A quick shout out to bricklink.com, the best place to find whatever you need piecewise.)',NULL),(415,17,'Who would you like to create a mosaic for? Why?','I\'d love to make a mosaic for a movie star or athlete and see it hanging on their wall. Maybe Jack Nicholson, or someone like that. That would be cool. Or even to have a piece displayed at a company or museum would be a big thrill. \r\n\r\nI made a mosaic of Zach Braff from \'Scrubs\", I think mostly because he\'s a pretty web savvy guy, and I figured there was a good shot that he would see it, and maybe buy it;) No such luck so far.\r\n\r\nI think that someday I should also do a \"self-portrait\", as I\'ve already made a mosaic of my wife and my son. We\'re looking at renovating our house soon, and adding a new room, and I\'m thinking a wall-sized mosaic of the whole family would be pretty awesome, though expensive. My wife has been awesome about my passion for Lego. She\'s very encouraging, and that makes everything easier. My son if 4, and apart from occasionally adding pieces to mosaics when I\'m not looking, he tend to take a lot of my loose brick and transport them around the table with his trains.',NULL),(416,17,'Does this affect your day job? Can you concentrate on other things?','The part of the mosaics that affects my day job is that I tend to lose track of time and stay up far too late building them. The best time for me to work on them is after my wife and son are sleeping, so that pretty much leads to me staying up too late.  It would be great to build mosaics for a living, but we\'re a ways away from that. They\'re a pretty select market, as most people don\'t have a couple thousand dollars lying around to spend on art, Lego or otherwise.\r\n\r\nOne of the side benefits of the Mosaics for me is that it teaches me patience. I\'m a pretty impatient guy, and I think working on something that I can\'t possibly finish in a day or even a week, is good for me. Having said that, I\'m getting pretty efficient at the mosaics. I had a friend come by, who had commissioned a piece for her parents, and she wanted to help put some pieces in, so that she could be a part of the process. She started putting some pieces in, and I was surprised at how much more quickly I was working than she was.',NULL),(417,18,'How many Lego sets do you have? What got you started?','I have about 16 sets at the moment not including boxes of RC train track. I originally started collecting lego when I was a couple of years old, for many years it was defiantly  my favorite toy and due to being ill when I was younger I acquired many sets as presents. That lego is now being played with by my nephew but my current collection was started early this year. I got inspired by some interesting lego pictures I saw then had a look around the net at the big lego train hobbyists towns and decided I wanted to start buying some more lego again.',NULL),(418,18,'Have you ever wanted to be a Lego Engineer?','Maybe when I was 6 or 7 but it\'s nothing thats really came into mind at an older age, but thats probably due to only being interested in lego again this year. I think it would be an amazing job being a Lego Engineer though, getting to design the best sets possible and building things with lego all day, sounds like a really fun job to me!',NULL),(419,18,'When you get a new kit, do you feel the need to start it right away','Actually I prefer to wait it out, I think as a kid I\'d have dived straight into it, wanting to build the toy as soon as possible but now a days I prefer to build lego sets to relax and keep myself busy at times of boredom. I think it\'s something that replaces my more recent hobby of building model aircraft and tanks.',NULL),(420,18,'What kit would you want to see Lego create? Describe it.','Ah thats a good question. Lego has been going for years and I\'ve noticed that they\'ve made a set for pretty much everything you can think of. I only really collect town sets now but I think perhaps they should make a set for adults, perhaps a busy night club or fancy wine bar would be different and amusing. I\'m sure lego could add some quirky detail to it. Also I\'ve always been a fan of the command and conquer series of RTS games so perhaps a tie into that would be really cool. Lego sets of some of the units and buildings. It\'s not such a far fetched idea as I\'ve actually seen peoples creations of CnC units on lego blogs, they have amazing attention to detail too!',NULL),(421,18,'What is your favorite piece? Which do you find the most versatile?','I don\'t really build enough custom models to answer that question, but there\'s so many lego parts that if there\'s something you want to build there\'s bound to be the right parts out there to build it. Thats what\'s so fascinating about lego you start off with a loud of random looking pieces and end up with a rubbish truck or ambulance or something really detailed and oddly shaped.',NULL),(422,18,'Why do you think Lego still holds its appeal among adults?','As an adult Legos appeal seems to be that ability to build anything we like out of just a few bricks or build something amazing out of thousands of bricks. If I had the space, the money and the time I\'d try and build some really amazing buildings and vehicles  but at the moment I don\'t but thats ok because the sets range in price and size that you can buy what you have the means to. I think adults who build lego are very nostalgic people who either must have collected lego as a child and got back into like me or started collecting it and never stopped. Lego always had a soft spot for me with happy memories from my childhood so I guess it\'s just really hard to let go of.',NULL),(423,21,'How many salt and pepper shakers do you have and why?','I have about 60 sets of salt and pepper shakers.  As I see sets that I am attracted to, I buy them.  They do not have to have a particular theme.',NULL),(424,21,'What draws you to a particular piece?','In the beginning, I was buying shakers that were representative of particular products that were commercialized on TV or in advertising.  Now, I will buy anything that just appeals to me.',NULL),(425,21,'Where do you get most of your finds?','My husband likes to go to flea markets to look for his clocks, and I would see salt and pepper shakers that I liked, and would purchase them.  Also, when we would be on vacation, I would look for shakers in that place where we visited.  However, I won\'t not buy sets that had the name of the city or state on them.',NULL),(426,21,'Do you use your shakers or are they on display only? Why?','The shakers that I buy are for display purposes only.  I don\'t want them to get broken or dirty, because they would not be worth anything then.  I  mostly just collect them for visual purposes anyway.',NULL),(427,21,'From your whole collection which shakers would you use to put on the table for dinner with: George W. Bush? Ellen DeGeneres? Marilyn Monroe?','For George W. Bush, I would use the two cows on the swing. It kind of represents a Southern atmosphere, and President Bush is from Texas, which is in the South. For Ellen DeGeneres, I would use my gingerbread men. They appear jolly and funny, and Ellen is a comedienne, and represents a funny nature. For Marilyn Monroe, I would use my Betty Boop salt shaker. It looks sexy, but sweet, and it is also an icon like Marilyn Monroe.',NULL),(428,22,'How many  napkin rings do you have and what got you started?','There are two sets of 6.  I got started collecting when I saw the complete set while on vacation and decided to purchase it for use.  I have a few other sets of napkin rings.',NULL),(429,22,'You seem to be partial to wood.

I have other sets that are made of metal, glass, ivory, etc.',NULL),(430,22,'What animals would you like to see that you don\'t have?','I have the African collection.

I first thought that there was a wire running through all of the beads but now I think they are glued together.  For example, how does the snake have a red tongue. I\'m endelessly fascinated. My biggest fear is that they are made by some child going blind in a factory.',NULL),(436,23,'What are they created for?','I believe they are cell phone charms but I have put them on various things.

I have been waiting patiently, though, for the right deal to come along. To get it as a gift would be even better.',NULL),(465,31,'You have quite a large Nolan Ryan collection. He had a number of career milestones on several different teams. Which one is your favorite and why?','I personally think that his 1973 season was amazing. He pitched two no hitters in one season, and set the single season strikeout record with 383. 1973 was also his first 20+ win season, and his first 300+ innings pitched season as well. It was a Cy Young season if I\'ve ever seen one. However, Jim Palmer won the award that year, and rightfully so. ',NULL),(466,31,'Which modern day pitcher reminds you the most of Nolan Ryan?

He has had a tough season this year, but when he\'s at the top of his game, he throws hard (not as hard as Ryan, but he can still reach the upper 90\'s), and can rely on the big strikeout.

These cars are what has been called the \" Aerodynamic wars\" in NASCAR. These \"wars\" included cars built by Chrysler, and Ford Motor Company using such names as Dan Gurney Special and Cale Yarborough Special and Superbird. During this period, all the manufacturers started to use colors relating to the new generation with names like Panther Pink, Plum Crazy, Sub Lime Green just to name a few.\r\nUsing this as the base line I would start with some of the outlandish options that you could order a car with including what was known as the \"mod top\" which included a floral design on the seats as well as on the vinyl top.\r\nDuring this time you could order some of the more sedate cars like the Montego and Fairlane from Ford Motor Company and Coronets and Satelites from Chrysler with any engine from the little 225 Slant Six, all the way up to the Boss 428 Cobra Jets and 426 Hemi.\r\nThis just shows that anything was possible during this time when you could litteraly order a car and make it as individual as you are.

New discoveries are constantly being made that force us to revise our ideas about the world; I think that my collection of dinosaurs is a fun way to illustrate this.

That connected me with some other collectors and I started seriously collecting JP and Safari figures.  I bought Copies of MARX and MPC figures from other collectors.

Later I wanted consistency of design, so I try not to mix figures from companies with different styles.  I try the use the same guidelines used making historical military miniatures or model railroaders use.  I make more an effort with the flora now.  No grass, flowering plants only for the terminal Cretaceous.  Originally I used plastic trees from the sets as is.  Now I try to paint or touch up the plants and exclude cactus and other out of period plants.  I have a series of reference books and the Dinosaur Encyclopedia from Hyper-works Software.  This gives pretty good pictures of the flora and fauna. Within the toy limits I try to be accurate.

I watch for their new releases every year.   My latest favorite toy line is Procon and the variety and choices of figures have me really interested.  Play Mobil sets also are fun.  You can only have so many T-rexâ€™s no matter how good they are.  I really like figures I have not seen before like Nigersaurus, Arizonasaurus and Shunosaurus.

Rhiannon a sophomore in college has edited some web pages for me and helped with pictures.  Sarah a freshman this year used to play Dinosaur Alphabet with us when she was younger.

We do visit the Museum of Natural History to see the dioramas, which are very well done.  We also visit the Botanical Gardens to see living relatives of Mesozoic plants.  But if I were asked I think I would like to see the Morrison dioramas displayed since the existing Late Jurassic diorama at the museum was done in the 50â€™s and is dated.  All the animals are tail draggers they live in a swamp and have anatomy issues.  I would keep the plants, which are very well done and detailed.  Perhaps I would suggest an Early Cretaceous diorama since they currently lack one.

Growing up in the Philippines, I didn\'t have much access to toys or literature, so most of my early exposure to dinosaurs was via TV shows like Land of the Lost. \r\nMy very first dinosaur toy was a dimetrodon my mother gave me. I still have it in my collection, thatâ€™s how much I treasured that thing! <br>\r\nI started collecting dinosaur figures about 11 years ago. It all started after a desert road trip from Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Utah. We dug fish fossils and visited many roadside dinosaur attractions. We also visited the Dinosaur National Monument. Along the way I started collecting dinosaur figures. I started collecting only my favorite group of dinosaurs, the sauropods and ceratopsians. It would be a few years before I expanded  my collection. <br><br> It all started with the release of the Battat line of dinosaur figures. Still considered as one of the best line of figures ever produced. I first laid eyes on them in a museum shop, thinking I could find them back home I decided not to purchase any at that time. I was wrong. After searching unsuccessfully, I contacted Battat directly and asked if they know of any retail store in Washington state that sells the figures. It turned out that there was one store in Seattle, 60 mile away from where I was living at that time, that carried the whole line. So I traveled 60 mile and finally found the store. I was hooked after that. To this day, the Battat rearing diplodocus  is still my favorite dinosaur figure. <br>\r\nThatâ€™s how my collection expanded. Now, I pretty much collect all the major lines. I also started collecting prehistoric mammals and birds which are not very well represented. Prehistoric Marine reptiles/amphibians and Pterosaurs are the latest group that I started developing interest in, so I am always on the lookout for new figures.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(500,38,'Where do you get your inspiration for your dioramas?','I mostly based it on documentaries. I also wonder a lot how the landscape will look like if the dinosaurs are still around. Every-time I go on a hike or camping I always try and picture how the scenery looks like with dinosaurs in them. I am also interested in how museums display their collections. ',NULL),(501,38,'You are given the go ahead to direct Jurassic Park 4? What is the plot?','If I were to direct JP4, I think I will take it to a direction in which it parallels what is currently going on in our natural world.  I find it totally unbelievable that the citizens of the world will just let a group of resurrected prehistoric animals be forgotten and not protected and not do anything.  In my version,  it would be all about trying to protect what was once viewed as something that needed to be eliminated . After years of neglect and isolation, the whole island has now become free for all. The dinosaurs are being hunted indiscriminately starting with the top predators. Realizing that the whole fauna is on the verge of a \"second\" total extinction, a group of citizens and a few scientist starts lobbying to try and save what is left of the island and it\'s prehistoric animals.<br> <br>A massive international effort to save the animals starts to take place. But there will be lots of bad guys still around who see the island and it\'s fauna not as an international treasure, but a very lucrative source of income. They want the island to remain unprotected and push to have it sold to a powerful private company before any international agreement is reached on  its designation and proper management and protection. There will be a lot of conspiracy and action. Lots of dinosaur chase scenes.<br>\r\nThat\'s how I would direct the movie. Now would people want to watch it? I don\'t know. If done correctly, I think it has potential. Viewers appreciate a good story line and not just  all about chase scene and special effects.  <BR>\r\nTo be honest, that\'s my  biggest issue with the last two JP movie. The first one was really good, but the ones after that was all about special effect and chase scene and not much substance. I\'m sure I\'m going to get criticism for saying that. \r\n\r\n',NULL),(502,38,'The T-Rex gets a lot of press. What dinosaur is underrated and why?','Yes, T-rex gets a lot of press! There are so many under rated species that it\'s impossible to choose just one. But as a group, I would say the prehistoric marine reptiles. You don\'t hear much press about them. But they are very fascinating group of animals. They are also under-represented in the toy lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(503,38,'Why do you think Americans have such a dinosaur fixation?','I don\'t think it\'s just Americans who have such fixation with dinosaurs.

I was always working with my parents in their food retail store my whole childhood, so what few toys I had I really did not have time to play with or break.  I still have those few toys including the 24 inch Alien with the head cap, and three shogun warriors in pretty good shape.

','As far as DC Comic book action figures, probably about 60-70.  What got me started was  a combination of a few things.  I loved action figures when i was a kid.  i had a fair collection but it wasnt too big and it mostly consisted of Star Wars and Transformers at the time.  My dad also had a lot of old comic books.  The ones I remember most are Batman Flash and Green Lantern.

There\'s still a big market for vinyl because of the sound, the novelty and the attractiveness of the cover art.  People collect as much to have the albums as to listen to them.  So they\'re still fairly available.  The better ones are tougher to find these days, but not as a result of mp3s. ',NULL),(528,44,'Be truthful. Do you air guitar? Why do guys do that? ','I do NOT - but I do occasionally play air trumpet and flute, because I play the actual instruments!  So I have an excuse. \r\n \r\nWhy do people play air guitar?  Beats me!  Maybe to release their inner child, or because after 8 beers they\'re liable to do anything, no matter how embarrassing.  Probably both.  Rule of thumb is: Only play air \"whatever\" if you play the real thing (except accordion. Just don\'t play air accordion - ever.  It causes psychological damage and can get you arrested for indecency).  And no matter what, never do it in front of your kids, and  especially not in front of your kids\' friends.  You want them to have a social life, don\'t you?\r\n \r\nAnd oh yeah, no matter how many beers you\'ve had, never, EVER take your shirt off and try to play air guitar on stage during an Aerosmith concert (wasn\'t me, I swear).  Despite what you may believe, women in the audience will NOT think you\'re as sexy as Steve Tyler, no matter how many beers they\'ve had. And trust me, the band does NOT appreciate it.  Neither does Security.  And they\'re bigger than you, and there are more of them, and they carry night sticks.  Big ones.  And they use them.

','The style that probably best describes my work would have to be non-  objective abstract expressionism. I think that best sums it up since   I\'m really not into painting precise realism and if I go over to   impressionism (like Monet), which I\'ve been known to do, or expressionism a la Picasso, I eventually grow bored and just let the creative instinct take over. I\'m happiest when the rules are broken such that I can come up with a compelling image. Sometimes it works and sometimes it fails miserably, but that\'s show biz\' I guess.',NULL),(530,43,'Who/what do you think has been your greatest influence?','My influences span a pretty wide spectrum, I think. Everything from the Peanuts and Doonesbury newspaper comics that I used to read when I was a kid to much of the art that has come out of China in the last five to ten years. But I would have to split them up between drawing and painting. For drawing, I\'m very much influenced by Rembrandt, DaVinci and Degas for his use of color and the Japanese ink drawings for their simplicity and reliance on gesture. I\'m also very much in debt to Cy Twombly who I dismissed at first, but who revealed how one could think so far out of the box and yet still touch the eye.  In painting, I\'m influenced I think most of all, by Joan Mitchell. Like Twombly, she really stretched the limits of the imagination with her defiance of formal technique.  Lately, I\'ve been into this artist from Milan, Italy named Alessandro Papetti, another figurative painter but more formal in subject and structure. Along the same vein I have to plug a fellow by the name of  Dan McDowell, from London, who does these great precise images of 1970\'s Times Square that incorporate this very interesting blurring technique. And I can\'t exclude Lucien Frued and Peter Doig as other contemporary fancies.',NULL),(531,43,'What amster (other?) work have you yet to paint?','Well, I really want to get back into watercolors and more drawings on a larger scale. Watercolors fascinate me and I tend to paint from a more formal perspective; landscapes, still life\'s and what not. The same with the drawings but I tend to free up the hand more with pens and pencils. I\'d also like to do more life studies and portraits.',NULL),(532,43,'What got you started in painting?','For me, it was a question of space. I\'d never until recently, had enough space or a private space,  to make a mess and be experimental since for the most part, my artistic training has been very brief; it was just simply something that I\'d done all my life in the confines of rental apartments or cottages. Around 2002, we found this house out in eastern Long Island that had an outdoor office that the previous tenant had used for his magazine and once I saw that I thought well, I know what\'s going in here and I\'ve been torturing myself ever since. But it\'s been a torture I welcome and enjoy',NULL),(533,43,'What medium have you yet to try?','I\'ve never done anything on mylar, which is this very smooth surface that I\'ve seen work done on by this Chinese artist whose name eludes me, just recently in Brooklyn. Also I\'ve never used board; I\'m strictly a canvas or paper person, never used some of the more unorthodox surfaces like glass or plate. But the reason I bring up board is because I recently went to the Elisabeth Peyton exhibition at the New Museum and was very impressed by her ability to create these brilliant portraits on wooden board by simply using oil paint. That really amazed me and got me thinking.',NULL),(534,43,'What do you think your art says about you?','I\'d say it\'s just another dimension of my being, where I\'ve come from Like many other mid-life career \"changers\", I just feel fortunate to have something else in my back pocket that I\'ve always wanted to devote time and energy to. I was speaking to a woman on the street recently and somehow the subject of art came up and she told me that it\'s good to be an artist, that you\'re leaving evidence of your existence. And I never really thought about it but I suppose she was right. Wether it be writing or whatnot, you\'re leaving behind some sort of tribute, maybe? of existence. Not to get all Sartre on you but maybe that\'s what it \'s all about.',NULL),(535,45,'How many albums do you have and what got you started? ','Well, when my collection was starting to take up considerable space, I thought it was high time to count and catalogue it. That was in 1996. By the time I had finished counting I had just over 4,500 lps. Now that was well over a decade ago, I really can\'t tell how much I\'ve got now because counting it became a bigger effort than it\'s worth. I\'ve bought a lot, but I\'ve also sold a few and given away a lot. That\'s part of what I like about collecting music, it\'s never static, some things I liked ten or twenty years ago I decide I can do without, plus there\'s always new music to discover.\r\n\r\nI\'d say my collecting really took off in the early nineties when folks were still switching over to compact disc. Coincidentally, that was when my interest in music was growing, and you could pick up a crate of records for a few bucks at a garage sale. Generally the music was so called \"classic rock\" of the seventies as you may expect, but the odd rock \'n\' roll instrumental or weird novelty 78rpm record would crop up, I always prized those things the most. From the onset the records were cheap so I didn\'t care for them very well, but when I started finding stuff that sounded great & it didn\'t exist on cd, that all changed!\r\n\r\n',NULL),(536,45,'What is the greatest album ever? ','Oh, there are several! Music is all about mood and since we all have different sides to us I don\'t think anybody could point to a single album and say, \"That\'s the one perfect statement\".  There are a few albums and singles I could just play continually and never get sick of.\r\n\r\nSyrinx were a Canadian prog group that lasted for only two albums, the second, \"Long Lost Relatives\" from 1971 is a favourite. As far as I know it hasn\'t been issued on disc. Another Canadian one would be David Pritchard\'s \"Nocturnal Earthworm Stew\" it was finally issued a few years back. The GRT version of Flower Travellin\' Band\'s \"Satori\" is some of the heaviest stuff of the seventies! It\'s a shame that band isn\'t held in the same regard as Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThese aren\'t albums but some of my favourite records are old rock 45\'s and 78\'s. Sandy Nelson\'s \"Let There Be Drums\" and Jorgen Ingmann\'s version of \"Apache\" really started my love for early rock \'n\' roll, and another one would be The Rio Rockers\' \"Mexican Rock \'n\' Roll instrumental\".  Dale Hawkins\' original \"Susie Q\" would make anyone forget about the CCR remake! I knew the song \"Just Because\" as a polka, but when I discovered the Collins Kids\' version I was in awe of this revved up rock-a-billy! That\'s when I realized there was a lot more to early rock \'n\' roll than \"Blueberry Hill\" or \"The Twist\"!\r\n\r\n',NULL),(537,45,'What are some of your favorite B-sides?','Wow, there\'s a lot really. For a non-hit \"Into The Void\" is probably the heaviest thing Black Sabbath ever recorded. The Beatles\' \"Within You Without You\" absolutely scared the crap out of me as a kid, now it may be my favourite Sgt. Pepper track.  The flipside to The Electric Prunes single \"Get Me To The World On Time\" was a song called \"Are You Lovin\' Me More\" and it proves a band doesn\'t need to go into an extended blues jam to take the listener into space! That song turns me into a drooling wreck at only two and a half minutes!',NULL),(539,45,' Which bands/performers should make an album together.

There\'s a certain amount of trust given when listening to her stuff, almost like in a real relationship, there\'s no singer today that even comes close on that level.\r\nI wondered what the results would be like if you had a singer of that calibre team up with a droning doom group such as Sunn O))).

Bloodshot Bill is an insane rockabilly guy from Montreal, I\'d describe him as across between Hasil Adkins and a pro wrestler! He sounds like a complete loon! Tabarnacos Surfers are also from Montreal. A really talented surf instrumental trio.\r\nI\'ve never grown out heavy music and I\'m amazed by the amount coming out of Italy in recent years! There\'s a label run by the graphic artist Malleus called Supernatural Cat Records and it\'s home to such spacey-doom monsters as Lento, Morkobot and UFOmammut. There are other great Italian acts such as Last Minute to Jaffna and Gum. I\'ve also been listening to eclectic groups like We Insist! and Flu.id. They are on a label called Exile on Mainstream.

It\'s Cat catches Rat. Moreover, I am a cat love, and Raymond was born in the year of Rat, it\'s like i have captured him, so funny and meaningful. As I was so intrigued by this snowglobe, and start realizing snowglobe could be very beautiful. So when i shopped around, i would go into gift stores, to check if there is any snowglobe to buy. I notice the existence of snowglobe before, but never really pay attention to it until Raymond gave me my first one. Once I start paying attention to snowglobes, I realize there are so many beautiful ones around, like the ones from Disney and many others from different designers and manufacturer. Putting their designs and thoughts inside a globe and with snow in it is just fascinating. So for the first few years, I start looking around wherever i go, and then in 2003, i discover ebay, and found that many snowglobes are being sold on line. My collection increase dramatically ever since. As my first snowglobe is a mini globe, 95% of my collection is mini globes with a diameter of 55mm and below. But I do have quite a few bigger ones.

At that time, I had around 898 snowglobes, all of them are mini snowglobes. They wrote back and said there is no such record, and would like to see if I want to set this record. It got me interested and I was applying for \"the Largest MINI Snowglobe collection in the world shared with me the list of documents required for the record, ie. photos of each globes, media coverage about the collection as well as 2 witnesses to verify the no. of my collection. It took me 6 months to prepare all the information and ready to send to the GWR headquarter. A few more months later, they issued my Guinness World Record and gave me the Largest Snowglobe Collection instead of Mini Snowglobe collection. Therefore, the globes that I have bigger than 55mm in diameter also counts in my collection. I have around 200 of the bigger ones now.  That was a fun ride.',NULL),(558,52,'You mention you wanted to start a museum. What would you call it and what would some of the halls be displaying? (in other words - will there be rooms broken up in a certain way - glitter  in one room, snow in another etc)','Yes, I would like to start a museum when my collection reaches 10000 pieces. I would call it \"Mini Globeland\" as the majority of my globes are small ones. I will display all my globes, and they will be featured in different halls, ie. halls of Advertising; Angels; Animals, Disney Characters, Movie Characters, Religions, Designers, Holidays and Celebrations, Locations, Sports, and Dual-purpose globes. Each halls will have it\'s own decoration and theme, giving a different mood to the guests. Moreover, I plan to have a souvenir shop where I can sell my future designs, and snowglobes from around the world, as well as merchandises with snowglobe design on it.\r\n ',NULL),(559,52,'So do you think you will ever start collecting larger globes? Why or why not?','As I mentioned earlier, I already have around 200 pcs of larger globes, but I will only buy them if they are very very pretty and interesting. I want to stay focus, and will only concentrate on the mini ones. Moreover, large snowglobe takes up a lot of space in my display room, and limiting the room for my mini globes. Therefore, I would be very selective when I buy bigger globes.',NULL),(560,52,'You\'ve spent a fair amount of money on your collection. Tell us about the most expensive one you\'ve bought to date and why you chose to pay that much.','The most expensive globe that I bought in my collection is actually not a mini globe. It\'s the Authentic Louis Vuitton Anniversary Snow Globe. This snowglobe was made to celebrate the 1st Anniversary of the opening of the Maison Louis Vuitton at 101, Avenue des Champs-Elysees, Paris.  There were a limited number sold.  This snowglobe is a tribute to the Jacques Henri Lartique photograph.The photograph was a world renowned image made to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of Louis Vuitton in 1999.The snowglobe shows a pile of LV Monogram Canvas Luggage in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. It stands about 5.75\" high, the base diameter is 3.25\", and it weighs 1 lb, 8 oz.It was not sold in the store, but only available for VIP to purchase privately. I had the opportunity to buy this from high end fashion store reseller in Hong Kong for HK$4,200, around USD560. I bought this snowglobe this year and because it\'s so special, and moreover, I am a fan of Louis Vuitton, that\'s why I am willing to pay so much for it. There is another one being sold on ebay for US 1200 now. ',NULL),(562,50,'How many Elvis items do you have and what got you started?',' I have many items that consist of watches, mugs, magazines, posters, clocks, a bronze statue, coins, CDs, movies. If I was to estimate it would be over 70 items +. I remember  watching TV and seeing Elvis perform. After the show they were showing a collectible item which was stamps. From then on I decided to start collecting\r\nmemorabilia of Elvis. It\'s like having a piece of Elvis even when he\'s not here.',NULL),(563,50,'What period of Elvis is your favorite and why?','  I don\'t have one favorite but two favorite periods of Elvis. The first would be his early days when he starred in his 1st movie, \"Love Me Tender\" in August of 1956. This was one of my favorite movies besides Viva Las Vegas. It was the Rock N\' Roll era I believe and \r\nit was a time that young America was into music and dancing.\r\nMy second favorite was and still is the 1968 Comeback  because I was born in \'68 and it showed that Elvis was back on top after that great performance.',NULL),(564,50,'If you could devise one piece of Elvis memorabilia for collectors out there, what would it be?','   If I was to devise a piece of an Elvis memorabilia it would be a large resin framed collage of Elvis\' career from the beginning toward the end in 3D detail, from his facial expressions to his clothing. That would be the ultimate\r\npiece of art work.',NULL),(565,50,'Who would win a smack down between Elvis and James Dean as icons and why?','  That\'s funny because I like both Elvis and James. I would think Elvis because of he sings the blues, country, gospel and rock n\' roll, his ability to attract huge crowds and getting the fans crazy. So, I say Elvis would win the smack down.',NULL),(566,50,'What is the most outlandish piece you own?',' I can\'t think of anything bizarre in my collection that I own. Maybe my bronze Elvis sitting down or maybe better yet my Elvis bust that sings and has an animatronic face. He even does his famous lip movement.\r\nIt\'s life like, you can say.\r\n  I\'ll be continuing collecting Elvis memorabilia for a long time until I\'m gray and old.',NULL),(567,53,'How many Elvis items do you have and what got you started? ','Not sure exactly how many items I have, on the site I believe is 126 items posted and there are a few missing as well. As for what got me started would be when I was a little girl living on the farm, always buying his albums as it was \"mother\" approved, lol.  So now I just sort of buy what I see and what I like and its taken over my apartment.\r\n',NULL),(568,53,'Do you prefer Elvis the actor or Elvis the singer? ','Although I own every Elvis Movie made, I do prefer Elvis as the singer.  Like every young girl you like the way he moves on stage, he puts so much emotion into how he sings with his actions etc., he really just puts his feelings into the songs.\r\n',NULL),(569,53,' If you were to design a living room devoted to Elvis, what would it look like? ','It would look like mine does, a shrine, Elvis wall to wall and floor to ceiling, although I could use more space, lol.\r\n',NULL),(570,53,'Given the King passed away way before his time, what would you have liked to have seen him do? ','Hmmm..... thats a tough question............basically just carrying on with his singing career and acting career.  And hoping that one day I would actually be able to see him in a concert.\r\n',NULL),(571,53,'You\'re having dinner with Elvis. Do you use the Elvis plates? What do you serve him? ','Well..........no I wouldn\'t use the Elvis plates I have, lol..........and as for serving him would be a nice home cooked meal with an appetizer of his favorite Fried Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches, lol, yuck.  But I would make it for him. lol.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(572,55,' How many Elvis items do you have and what got you started?','I have a lot of books that have been written about Elvis and his family & colleagues.  I also have a lot of signs and a couple clocks of Elvis as well, my most favorite collectible is the Elvis pez dispenser which I got last year.  I got started when I was in the 6th grade and I was in my music class, that is where I found out that I was born the same day Elvis died because we were studying Elvis at the time in class.  Ever since then I have been an avid Elvis collector and fan!',NULL),(573,55,'I\'m sure you have many memories of Graceland, but is there one that sticks out the most and what happened?','I know its strange but I have actually only been to Graceland twice in my entire life.  The second time was August of 2007 and I flew down with my dad to celebrate my 30th birthday.  Spending that time on vacation with my dad and having that father/son bonding time was great.  I plan on visiting Graceland every 5 years to not only celebrate my birthday but to also celebrate with the rest of the world the greatest entertainer Elvis.',NULL),(574,55,' What is your favorite Room in the mansion, what does it look like (for those that have never been there) and why is it your favorite? ','My favorite room is the green room which is off of the kitchen.  Everything in the room is green, the carpet is green, the chairs are green, the walls I believe are even green.  It also has a waterfall in the room that has a green light on it.  With green being my favorite color it makes the \"green room\" my favorite room in the mansion.',NULL),(575,55,'Have you decorated any of your house in the Graceland style?','I haven\'t decorated my current home in Graceland style, but when I lived in St Louis a few years ago I had a finished basement.  When I finished the basement I decided it would be the \"Elvis\" basement so I decorated it with everything that I could find that had to with Elvis.  I would have made the walls and carpet green to match the \"green room\" in Graceland if it wouldn\'t have hurt the resale value of my home.\r\n\r\n',NULL),(576,55,'What\'s it like to spend your birthday at Graceland? ','I spent my 26th and 30th birthday at Graceland, for my 30th birthday I was with my dad so it was extra special.  It\'s absolutely amazing to see the hundreds of Elvis fans gather at Graceland each year during the week he passed, more known as the Elvis week and celebrating the life of Elvis.  Each year on August 15th which is the eve of Elvis\' death they do a candle light vigil at night, its truly amazing to see Graceland lit up with everyone\'s candles.  Graceland is a place every single person in the world needs to visit at least once, the best time to go is always during the week of August 16th or his birthday week. \r\n ',NULL),(577,56,' Let\'s talk about the Obama piece. Prescient or just hopeful?','Actually, this piece is not particularly pro-Obama nor is it anti-McCain, but rather an attempt to document the election itself metaphorically.  By making Obama large and from pennies and nickels alone, while creating McCain from quarters, dollars and dimes, I was trying to allude to the fact that each candidate represented a dramatically different voter demographic--one a multitude of the underprivileged and struggling, the other a small number of wealthy elite.',NULL),(578,56,'You\'re clearly drawn to money, at least in concept. Isn\'t that ironic for the starving artist type?','Indeed, the entire premise of our existence is intrinsically linked to finance, and as an artist reacting to society, it is a theme that continuously arises.  My own personal experience with ongoing impoverishment pushes me to explore it further, in frustration, as an attempt to capture and conquer.  ',NULL),(581,56,'We love that you use objects in a different way than originally intended, particularly toys. Where do you draw your inspiration?','My impetus for making what I make is linked to one of two things:  frustration, or fascination.  The types of toys that are fascinating to me are those that depict miniature versions of actual things, which, when used with thorough repetition, create images of things that frustrate me.  ',NULL),(582,56,'Do we need to have our toy collectors send you old, unwanted parts?','If they\'d like to, of course I would gladly accept.  Inevitably, when I  accumulate a large amount of any one thing, it eventually leads to the inspiration for a new piece',NULL),(583,56,'Last year you had an accident which your severed two tendons in your hand. Did the experience affect the way in which you approach your work?','Yes, definitely.  After a month or two of inactivity, I gingerly entered into mosaic-making, which is more or less possible to create with one hand. ',NULL),(584,56,'What great work have you yet to do?','It is always my mission to continuously outdo myself visually, metaphorically, and technically.  The last eight years have been rife with frustrated, aggravated imagery.  I am hoping to make artwork that can be more fun, more triumphant, and more impressive than ever, and then to continue doing the same.  ',NULL),(585,60,' It\'s a really interesting thing to collect based on ethnicity, and even as a long-time figure collector, it never really occurred to me. Where did it all start?',' Where so many good ideas start, I guess... during a drunken rant. I believe I was having a lengthy conversation with a group of friends, and everyone was relating their favorite toys growing up. I made the comment that I had Star Wars figures, but one could only \"be\" Lando so many times. There really were very few toys that actively looked like me growing up. I guess I decided to start collecting ones that did.',NULL),(586,60,' How many of these have you managed to collect? And is it an active hunt, or an \'if I see it, I\'ll get it\' kind of thing?',' I have around 200 or so  and I troll the local shops when I get a chance. If I hear that one is being released, I hunt it down. If not, I just go looking. Friends are also responsible for many figures from all over the world. I\'ve been getting figures from family and friends for years. I also admit to sometimes going to web stores like Entertainment Earth to see what is out there.',NULL),(587,60,' Now, when you mention \'not necessarily human\', are you talking about figures like Star Trek\'s Lt. Worf?','Indeed. I have also created honorary places for characters like Dr. Teeth, Black Manta, and... for my wife... Johnny Cash. Her Man in Blaction.',NULL),(588,60,'Do you have any especially rare or valuable pieces?','Hmm. I think the Flava Flav alarm clock is valuable, now, and the full statues were on the expensive side, like the \"modern\" Luke Cage. I think one of the things that I really enjoyed about the hobby was that everything, more or less, is reasonably priced - just hard to find. And people can get me a gift, and really make me happy for under $20.',NULL),(589,60,' Is there a kind of Holy Grail you\'re always kinda watching for?',' I guess obscure and well done. I\'d love to get my hands on Samuel L. Jackson\'s character from Unbreakable, \"Mr. Glass\". I do not have any disabled figures. And without a doubt, my personal Holy Grail would be a Sly Stewart live at Woodstock. I don\'t know what I\'d do if I found that.',NULL),(590,94,'What got you started in collage?',' I had been collecting images for years before I went through a decoupage phase where I was covering doors and walls of my apartment with cut out images.  I moved around a lot in my early twenties and it bothered me to leave my favorite images behind so I shifted to collage which was more practical and portable.',NULL),(591,94,'Who/what do you think has been your greatest influence besides the Dada movement? ',' Being married to an artist has probably been the largest and most personal influence I could have had.  My husband is an artist/illustrator (Matte Stephens) and he gives me constant encouragement and support.',NULL),(592,94,'What medium(s) have you yet to try?',' I would like to try both oil painting and put more effort into my photography.  I take a lot of photos but just of random things I see, I\'m too shy to ask people to pose for me.',NULL),(593,94,'What do you think your art says about you? ','I seem to alternate between being a realist and an escapist.  My collage feels more like the real world and then I paint an alternate reality that I would like to live in.',NULL),(594,94,'What great work have you yet to do?',' I don\'t think artists are ever satisfied, the great work is always in the future, not yet created. Part of you never wants to create the \"greatest\" piece you\'ll ever do,\r\nbecause then there would be no reason to continue.',NULL);
