Smart Youtube plugin allows you to insert full featured YouTube videos into your post, comments and in RSS feed. 

== Description == 

Smart Youtube is a Wordpress Youtube Plugin that allows you to easily insert Youtube videos/playlists in your post, comments and in RSS feed. 

The main purpose of the plugin is to correctly embed youtube videos into your blog post. The video will be shown in full in your RSS feed as well.

Smart youtube also supports playback of high quality videos, works on iPhone, produces xHTML valid code (unlike YouTube embed code), allows you to view videos in fullscreen,  supports YouTube playlists (normal/HD) and the new outube IFRAME embed code.

The plugin is designed to be small and fast and not use any external resources. It has a number of customizable options.

Main Features:

* Easily embeds YouTube videos (normal/HD, both youtube.com and youtu.be links)
* Embed YouTube playlist (normal/HD)
* Supports latest high quality video protocols (360p and HD quality 720p)
* Allows full YouTube customization (colors, border, size, full screen...)
* Supports video deep linking (starting at desired point with &start=time parameter)
* Works on iPhone, iPad and iPod
* Supports migrated blogs from Wordpress.com
* Supports migration from other Youtube plugins such as wp-youtube
* Provides a sidebar widget for videos as well
* Produces xHTML valid code
* Very fast and light, no extra scripts needed

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.
3. Use the Options page to change your options
4. When you want to display Youtube video in your post, copy the video URL to your post and change http:// to httpv:// (notice the 'v' character)

The video will be automatically embedded to your post in the proper way.

Example: httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWfksMD4PAg

If you want to post a high quality/HD video  you would use httpvh:// ('vh' for video high)

To embed a playlist use extension 'vp'

Additionally, you can set how do you want the video to be displayed in your RSS feed. Smart Youtube can show the preview image of the video (automatically grabbed from Youtube), the link to the video, or both. I recommend enabling only the preview image.
